# Sudoku_Game

Note
1. Implemented with requirejs, the modules were missing some dependencies initially

How the game works
1. The user is initally presented an empty board and two buttons. First button will initialize the board with preset values.
Second button will solve the reset of grid 
2. I primiarliy focused on using HTML5,CSS and Javascript for this problem
3. I am still in the progress of implementing a requirejs to provide an modular implementation

Improvements to work on
1. This program could definietly use some more styling to the box and button elements
2. As far as the algorithimg is concerened i used backtacking technique to check for duplicate values. But i would like to also take the 
approach of using the expected sum rather than checking for duplicate values.
3. Could add styling to grids if the user hovers on the board
4. Instead solving the grid, implemente a 'hint' mechanism as the user progresses with the board
